        <p>The term “Engineering” has originated from the Latin word Ingenium means ‘Cleverness and Ingeniare means ‘to create’.</p>
        <h3>Courses & Eligibility</h3>
        <p class="italicfont">What are the courses available in Engineering Field?</p>
        <p>Engineering courses are available at diploma level, undergraduate level, postgraduate and doctoral levels.</p>
        <p class="italicfont">Diploma Course leading to Diploma in Engineering</p>
        <p>It is a 3-year course which students can pursue after the completion of 10 years of school education.
             Diploma holders are eligible for lateral entry to the third semester Engineering Courses.
             Diploma in Engineering is offered in various disciplines.</p>
        
        <p class="italicfont">Undergraduate Course leading to B.Tech Degree</p>
        <p>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) is the 4-year full-time undergraduate course in engineering. 
            This course can be done with one of the engineering discipline. Prerequisites for pursuing B.Tech
            is 10+2 passed with PCM group from the recognized educational board.</p>

        <p class="italicfont">Postgraduate Course leading to M.Tech Degree</p>
        <p>Postgraduate course in engineering resulting in the award of a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or Master 
            of Technology (M.Tech) degree . It is a 2-years course that one can pursue after completing a 4-year 
            undergraduate program in engineering (B.Tech).</p>

        <p class="italicfont">Doctoral Course in Engineering</p>
        <p>Doctoral of Philosophy in Engineering (Ph.D) is the advanced research course in engineering that has 
            the duration of 3 years. Course duration varies from college to college. Students admitted to the 
            Ph.D. program should have a master degree in respective discipline.</p>
        
        <p><h3>Admission</h3></p>
        <p>Admissions in the UG and PG engineering courses is done through entrance examination. The admission 
            to undergraduate programs of all the NITs and other reputed engineering colleges  is done through 
            Joint Entrance Examination Main (JEE Main 2020). For admission to IITs (Indian Institute of Technology),
            students have to appear the JEE Advanced 2020.</p>
        
        <p>Some states also organize their own entrance test for providing admission to B.Tech programme. Some state 
            level entrance exams are BCECE 2020 conducted by Bihar state, JCECE 2020 conducted by Jharkhand state, 
            TS EAMCET 2020 by Telangana state, AP EAMCET 2020 of Andhra Pradesh state.</p>
